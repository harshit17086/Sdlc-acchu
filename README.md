# AI in SDLC: Transforming Software Development with AI

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance and revolutionize the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It provides a modern, futuristic UI for exploring AI applications across all SDLC stages, with a particular focus on requirement gathering and test case generation.

## AI Features

### 1. AI-Powered Requirements Analysis
- Extract structured requirements from natural language project descriptions
- Automatically identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements
- Ensure consistency and completeness in requirements

### 2. AI-Powered Test Case Generation
- Create comprehensive test cases based on software requirements
- Support multiple testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress, Selenium, etc.)
- Generate test scenarios including edge cases and exception handling

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following content:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
   ```

4. Get a free Hugging Face API key:
   - Create an account at [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/)
   - Go to your profile > Settings > Access Tokens
   - Create a new token and copy it to your `.env` file

5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

## Using the AI Tools

1. **Requirements Analysis**:
   - Navigate to the "AI Tools" page
   - Enter a detailed project description in the input field
   - Click "Generate Requirements"
   - Review the structured requirements generated by the AI

2. **Test Case Generation**:
   - After generating requirements, click "Use for Test Generation" or manually enter requirements
   - Select your preferred testing framework
   - Click "Generate Test Cases"
   - Review and copy the generated test cases for your project

## Implementation Details

The AI integration uses the Hugging Face API with the Mistral-7B-Instruct model, which provides:
- Zero cost usage (free tier)
- High-quality natural language processing
- Robust understanding of software development concepts

For production use, you may want to consider:
- Using a more powerful model like GPT-4 or Claude 3 Opus
- Implementing rate limiting and error handling
- Adding more sophisticated prompt engineering

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: React application with Tailwind CSS
- `backend/`: Express API server
- `backend/src/routes/ai.ts`: AI integration endpoints
- `frontend/src/pages/AIToolsPage.tsx`: UI for AI tools
